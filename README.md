# Hierarchical Clustering

This is a reimplementation of Muellner's memory efficent generic linkage algorithm (linkage vector) using centroid linkage. There are some things I would like to adapt in the future, but for now to get a better understanding of how his algorithm works and develop my C++ skills in the process.
